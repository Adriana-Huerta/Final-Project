## Description
This project will have a digital rain effect, trails of colorful drips will run down the screen. While in the forefront a still image will show and overlap the rain, it will not be covered by the effect at all.

## Features
- Digital rain
	- Add code that will have the screen background covered in rain trails.
- Changing color of the rain
	- Change the color of the drops and trails within the rain code.
- A still image in the forefront 
	- Import an image I've made and place it in the forefront.

## Challenges
- How to overlap images without the rain covering the picture.
- I will need to have the rain change color.
- I will need to learn how to import the drawing in the first place.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The still image will be in the forefront, undisturbed while colorful digital rain covers the screen in the background.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Have rain and picture show up on screen.
