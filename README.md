## Description
I CAST FIREBALL is a program I made to showcase a wizard with a love for fireballs. All you do is play as a wizard and shoot fireballs. You can move around with your left and right arrow keys and to shoot fireballs you will need to press spacebar. That's the simple premise of this game, but in all honesty it plays more like an art piece than an actual game seeing as it doesn't have any obstacles or enemies you would have to encounter. The main stylized look of it comes fromt the firewall in the background. I just took the same digital rain code we learned in class and reworked te color a bit so the shades would come out more in red hues and the such. And honestly I think it came out looking mighty pretty, acting as a backdrop for our wizard to run around and cause more chaos.

Other than that I believe I would need to explain the files in my code. I didn't include any major confusing looking ones since that's not what I was looking for and not necessarily needed for my vision. I just imported drawings I made for this project. In the files includes two castles, a wizard, and a fireball image which are all used in game. I personally like the style I've chosen for this game. Very silly and not serious like, since my first thought was to just use png images off of google but that wouldn't have been as much fun for me. So I got to it and drew the pieces you see in the program.

I do believe that is everythig I would want to say about my project, albeit it's not the most impressive work, I still do like the work and effort I put into this. The mix of silliness with the beuty of the firewall, it's a nice mix of art and science I'd like to think.
